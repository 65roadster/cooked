	'Preheat oven to 375 degrees with rack in middle position.',
	'Spread cheese on a plate and place in freezer until ready to use.',
	'Set a metal cooling rack over a rimmed backing sheet. Fold a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil to form a 10\" x 6\" rectangle. Center foil on cooling rack and poke holes in foil with skewer. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.',
	'Heat butter in 10\" skillet over medium-high heat until foaming; add onion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, and paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomato juice. Cook, stirring to scrape up browned bits from pan, until thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to small bowl and set aside to cool.',
	'Whisk broth and eggs in large bowl until combined. Sprinkle gelatin over liquid and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, mustard, saltines, parsley, salt, pepper, and onion mixture. Crumble frozen cheese into a coarse powder and sprinkle over mixture. Add ground beef; mix gently with your hands until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Transfer the meat to foil and shape into a 10\" x 6\" oval about 2\" high. Smooth top and edges of meatloaf with a moistened spatula. Bake until instant-read thermometer registers 135-140F, 55-65 minutes. Remove meat loaf from oven and turn on the broiler.',
	'<#>Make Glaze:</#>',
	'While meatloaf cooks, combine ingredients for glaze in a small saucepan; bring to simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring, until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes.',
	'Spread half of glaze evenly over cooked meatloaf with a rubber spatula; place under broiler and cook until glaze bubbles and begins to brown at edges, about 5 minutes.',
	'Let meatloaf cool about 20 minutes before slicing.'
